# P2P Tutoring Marketplace

## Vision

The **P2P Tutoring Marketplace** aims to create a decentralized platform where students and tutors can connect seamlessly without intermediaries. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, this project envisions a transparent, secure, and efficient ecosystem that empowers learners and educators alike.

## Features

1. **Decentralized Tutoring Sessions**:
   - The smart contract facilitates direct connections between students and tutors, eliminating the need for third-party platforms.

2. **Secure Payment Mechanism**:
   - Payments for tutoring sessions are handled securely using an escrow mechanism. Funds are transferred automatically upon booking the session, ensuring trust and transparency.

3. **Session Management**:
   - Students can book sessions by providing the tutor's address and the amount to be paid. Tutors can mark sessions as complete once they are finished, providing a simple workflow for both parties.

4. **State Management**:
   - Each tutoring session is represented as a resource with its own state, including the student, tutor, payment amount, and completion status.

5. **Assertions for Security**:
   - The contract includes assertions to ensure that only the correct tutor can mark a session as complete and that a session can only be marked complete once.

## Future Scope

1. **User Interface Development**:
   - Creating a user-friendly frontend that interacts with the smart contract, allowing users to easily navigate the platform and manage sessions.

2. **Reputation System**:
   - Implementing a reputation or rating system for tutors and students to foster trust and improve the overall quality of tutoring.

3. **Advanced Search Functionality**:
   - Adding search filters based on subject expertise, availability, and tutor ratings to help students find the best match for their needs.

4. **Multi-Currency Support**:
   - Expanding the payment mechanism to support multiple cryptocurrencies, providing users with more flexibility in transactions.

5. **Analytics and Insights**:
   - Offering analytics to both tutors and students on their session history, performance, and engagement metrics.

6. **Integration with Learning Management Systems (LMS)**:
   - Allowing integration with existing LMS platforms to enhance the learning experience and provide more resources to students.

## Conclusion

The **P2P Tutoring Marketplace** is designed to revolutionize the way tutoring services are offered by utilizing blockchain technology for security, transparency, and efficiency. The project has significant potential for growth and adaptation in the evolving landscape of education technology.
